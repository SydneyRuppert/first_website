                <h1>My Favorite Spot: Austria</Spot:Austria></h1>
                <strong><small>
                    I believe every city has a certain feel and mood to it. For me, Billy Joel's song Vienna nailed that very feeling.

                <p>The funny thing about my time in Vienna was that I had no intention of actually spending much time there. It was just where I found the cheapest flights to and from Europe. Upon my arrival I had intended on only spending two days there but when 
                    I arrived my backpack was stranded so I had to extend my stay 3 more days for a total of 5. This ended up being some of my favorite memories of the entire trip. So before I get to tangled in my memories let me explain the feeling I mentioned above. 
                    Vienna was angsty French pop songs and run down cafe's. It was a fresh baked croissant and days spent interpretting art with new friends.</p>

                <h1>Budapest: An Unplanned Tattoo</h1>
                <strong><small>
                    Budapest had been a suggestion from a friend I met in Spain,the country I was in right before Budapest, and boy was I happy I took it.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>At this point in my travels, all preset plans and city's that I had systematically wanted to visit dissapeared and I found myself just country hopping based off strangers/new found friends reccomendations. In Budapest I was quickly swept up into the 
                    night life which was amazing almost soley for the Alice in Wonderland themed bars and the way the days were never without the best company. In Budapest I met an artist who worked at a tattoo shop and quickly asked if they could be part of my next 
                tattoo experience. Since I had grown close to the artist I felt compelled. My back is now the canvas to a beautiful Dragon.</p>

                <h1>Amsterdam:The Red Benches</h1>
                <strong><small>
                    Amsterdam was the city that perplexed me the most. It appeared to be this slow, artsy, cottag-like city filled with bakery's and bike riders galore but it had this dark underbelly I found amazing.

                    width="400"
                    height="200">

                </fig>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>One of the first things I noticed about Amsterdam was the quiant feel of the canals and the parks. The cobble stone streets and the beautiful row of homes looked
                    straight out of a Wes Anderson film. The monochromatic nature was only mad emore shocking by the contrast to the bright red benches along the canals. 
                    The whole city felt so wholesome until I went out at night into the heart of the city and then the contrast of the wholesome facade to the sultry red 
                    benches made much more sense.

                        <h1>Why I Decided To Become A Programmer:</h1>
                <strong><small>
                    I have always been someone who deeply enjoyed learning. I was the oddball who loved school and enjoyed overachieving for the sake of learning. No pushy parents breathing down my back or shoes to fill. Just a lover of reading, puzzles, and anything that left me flummoxed.
                </small></strong>
                <p>After I graduated college, with a degree in Plant Biology and Horticulture, I found myself in a pinch to find a job I liked that didn't pay peanuts.
                    I soon found that I was bored at my lab jobs because of the monotonous task and simple work. I missed feeling challenged like I had been in school and even when I solo traveled.
                    Since I have friends in programming who have such a deep love for the challenging nature and never stop talking about their love for their job I decided to take a deeper look. In addition to enjoying their work, all of them
                    had the freedom to travel to visit family and explore the world. After watching youtube after youtube exploring the world of programming, I could tell
                    that it would be a challenging and rewarding career. And as an added bonus, I could travel more and continue to add to my list of favorite cities.
